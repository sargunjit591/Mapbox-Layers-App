# Advanced Surveyor Mapping Application

A sophisticated geospatial surveying solution engineered for professional surveyors. This Android application integrates advanced MVVM architecture, dynamic Mapbox integration, and robust spatial analytics to deliver precise mapping and data management.

## Features

- **Advanced MVVM & DI:**  
  Modular architecture using dependency injection and repository patterns for scalable, testable code.

- **Mapbox Integration:**  
  High-performance vector tile rendering with dynamic multi-layer overlays (lines, points, polygons).

- **Reactive Processing:**  
  Asynchronous API calls managed with Kotlin Coroutines and Flows, ensuring responsive UI with cancellation support.

- **GeoPackage Storage:**  
  Offline geospatial data management using SQLite-based GeoPackage for advanced spatial queries.

## Architecture

Built on a clean MVVM framework, the application leverages dependency injection for modularity and uses Kotlin Flows to handle asynchronous operations seamlessly.
